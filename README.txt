Used Libraries:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Tensorflow
4. SciKit Learn
5. Math

Required Instructions:

model.h5 contains the trained model.
In the code, sample_input.csv is the file name of which the model is to be tested, so if testing on a file with other name change the name first. Also, sample_close.txt is the file containing the actual values so if the csv file is changed change its name also accordingly.

Next, in order to run the program properly, import all the required files such as model.h5, sample_input.csv and sample_close.txt

Model Used:

Combined model of Bidirectional LSTM and GRU with 75 layers, 280 epochs, batch size 128, dropout rate 0.01 and learning rate 0.0001
